Earl
====

A flexible redirect server.

TODO: Put hipster build status badges here.

Earl is a server that serves redirects for pre-configured url patterns. It is
your personal scriptable link shortener.

Example
-------

Suppose Earl is running in my local network, at the host `earl`. Then I can
navigate to `http://earl/repo/earl`, and I will be redirected to
`https://github.com/ruuda/earl`.

Building
--------

TODO: Actual docs. TL;DR: `stack build`.
